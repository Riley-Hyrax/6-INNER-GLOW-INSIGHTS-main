                                <h6>How many years National Insurance do you need to get a full state pension?</h6>
                            </div>

                            <div class="article-content">

                              <p>How many years National Insurance do you need to get a full state pension? Can you pay extra years if you don&rsquo;t have a full National Insurance record? And can you stop paying National Insurance if you&rsquo;ve already paid enough for a full state pension?</p>
                              <h2>How many years National Insurance for a full state pension</h2>
                              <p>Since April 2016, when the new state pension was introduced, you need 35 years of National Insurance (NI) to get the full state pension. However, it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated than that.</p>
                              <p>
                                Those 35 years of National Insurance must have been &lsquo;contracted in&rsquo; in order to count fully. <br>
                                If you have been contracted out at any time, you will not receive the full state pension amount if you have 35 years of NI. <br>
                                If you built up more of a pension before April 2016 than the full amount of the pension (&pound;164.35 a week in 2020 &ndash; 19), you got to keep it.
                              </p>
                              <p><strong>SAVVY TIP</strong>: Being contracted out meant that you and your employer paid a reduced rate of National Insurance. If you were in a final salary pension scheme, the employer had to make certain guarantees so that you wouldn&rsquo;t lose out.</p>
                              <h3>Were you contracted out or contracted in?</h3>
                              <p>If you&rsquo;ve been a member of a public sector pension scheme, or a private sector workplace pension that was a final salary pension or one based on an average of the salary you earned, you are likely to have been contracted out.</p>
                              <p>
                                You wouldn&rsquo;t have made an individual decision to contract out. Instead, the entire workplace pension scheme was either contracted in or contracted out. <br>
                                When you joined the pension scheme, you may not have been told that you were contracted out. Or if you were, you would not have been told you would receive a lower state pension as a result.
                              </p>
                              <p><strong>SAVVY TIP</strong>: This way of being contracted out was abolished in April 2016.</p>
                              <p>There are two other ways that you may have been contracted out.</p>
                              <p>
                                If you were in a &lsquo;defined contribution&rsquo; workplace pension (i.e. a pension pot type pension scheme), this may have been contracted out. This practice was abolished in April 2012. <br>
                                You may have chosen to pay a reduced amount of National Insurance, with the difference between this and the &lsquo;standard&rsquo; rate being paid into a personal pension. This practice was abolished in April 2012.
                              </p>
                              <h3>Why weren&rsquo;t you told about the effects of being contracted out at the time?</h3>
                              <p>The reason that you would not be told you&rsquo;d receive a lower state pension by being contracted out is that at the time it didn&rsquo;t affect the basic state pension you received. Until April 2016, the state pension was divided into two parts: the basic state pension and the additional pension.</p>
                              <p>
                                The basic state pension, which is the fixed amount that you would receive per week, was not affected by you being contracted out. <br>
                                It was the SERPS or state second pension that you were &lsquo;contracted out&rsquo; of. The additional pension was abolished for people who reach state pension age when the new pension was introduced on or after April 6th 2016.
                              </p>
                              <p><strong>SAVVY TIP</strong>: SERPS was related to how much you earned and not available to people who were self employed. Therefore, not everyone was entitled to a SERPS pension from the state in the first place.&nbsp;<sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</sup></p>
                              <h3>How the new state pension is worked out</h3>
                              <p>For people who start their working life after April 2016, they need 35 years of National Insurance to get the full state pension, which in tax year 2020 &ndash; 19, is &pound;164.35 a week.</p>
                              <p>For people who reach state pension age after April 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2016, but who paid National Insurance before then. Your pension will be based on what&rsquo;s called a &lsquo;starting amount&rsquo;. This is the higher of:</p>
                              <p>
                                What you would have got at April 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;2016 under the old system;&nbsp;this is a basic pension for 30 years of NI contributions plus any SERPS or state second pension you&rsquo;ve already built up, OR <br>
                                What you would get under the new system, namely a full flat rate pension for 35 years of contributions (reduced if you&rsquo;ve paid less than 35 years of National Insurance) minus a deduction if you were contracted out in the past.
                              </p>
                              <p><strong>SAVVY TIP</strong>: If you were contracted out in the past, this means that even though you have 35 years of National Insurance, you won&rsquo;t get the full state pension. However, you can pay extra years of National Insurance to try and fill in this gap.</p>
                              <p>Any National Insurance you pay after April 6th 2016 builds on this starting amount.</p>
                              <h3>What does the online state pension statement tell you?</h3>
                              <p>If you&rsquo;ve tried to get an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-state-pension">online state pension statement,</a>&nbsp;it will tell you the number of full years of National Insurance you have, the state pension you&rsquo;re currently on track to receive and how much you could get if you carry on paying National Insurance.</p>
                              <p>However, from information I&rsquo;ve been given by Savvy Sam users, the DWP isn&rsquo;t always giving the right information when it comes to being contracted out. I&rsquo;m still trying to get to the bottom of this, but it&rsquo;s taking far longer than I&rsquo;d hoped.</p>
                              <h3>Can you stop paying National Insurance if you have a full state pension?</h3>
                              <p>Sadly the answer is no. National Insurance doesn&rsquo;t only pay for your full state pension, but for the NHS as well. You have to carry on paying National Insurance, if you&rsquo;re working and earning more than a certain amount, until you reach state pension age.</p>
