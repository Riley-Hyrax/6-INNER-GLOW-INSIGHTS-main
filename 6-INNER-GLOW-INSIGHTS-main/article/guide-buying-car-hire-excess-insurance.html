                            <div class="article-content">

                              <h3><strong>What your car hire insurance covers</strong></h3>
                              <p>The insurance you get when you hire a car will normally cover you in a similar way to a comprehensive car insurance policy would do in the UK. However, there are some differences:</p>
                              <p>
                                <strong>It normally has a large excess</strong>; typically of several hundred pounds but it can be as much as &pound;1,000 or more. <br>
                                <strong>It doesn&rsquo;t generally cover damage to the roof</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>tyres, window and undercarriage of the car.
                              </p>
                              <p>Don&rsquo;t even think about hiring a car without taking care of the excess on the insurance policy unless you&rsquo;re happy to pay a hefty bill should the worst happen. I&rsquo;ve spoken to people who have been charged several hundred pounds because they hadn&rsquo;t taken out excess liability insurance and their car&rsquo;s had a minor scratch. Be warned!</p>
                              <h3><strong>Buying car hire excess insurance</strong></h3>
                              <p>Shop around for car hire excess insurance in advance so you don&rsquo;t have to sign up to the policy you&rsquo;re offered by the car rental company. You don&rsquo;t have to buy it from the company you&rsquo;re hiring the car from. In fact, it will be cheaper if you buy it from a specialist car hire excess insurance company.</p>
                              <p>You can generally buy car hire excess insurance as an annual policy or to cover a single trip. If you want it for a single trip, it&rsquo;s priced on a &lsquo;per day&rsquo; basis.</p>
                              <p><strong>SAVVY TIP:</strong>&nbsp;You will generally pay more if you want to drive in certain countries, although the price difference varies from provider to provider.</p>
