                            </div>

                            <div class="article-content">

                              <p>If you want to start the year by saving money on your mortgage, what deals are on offer and how much can you save? Find out who offers the lowest two-year fixed rate mortgages.</p>
                              <h2>Cheapest two-year fixed rate mortgages</h2>
                              <p>I looked at the lowest two-year fixed rate mortgage deals for remortgage and used mortgage broker London and Country&rsquo;s best buy tables.</p>
                              <p>The more equity you have, the lower the rate of interest you&rsquo;ll pay. Shorter fixed rate mortgages tend to charge a lower rate of interest than longer ones &ndash; although the difference may be less than you think! However, some banks and building societies are more competitive than others.</p>
                              <p><strong>SAVVY TIP</strong>: Competitive mortgage deals tend to be pulled by the bank or building society with little or no notice. So, something that&rsquo;s available one day may not be the next.</p>
                              <h3>How these mortgages are ranked</h3>
                              <p>These mortgages are ranked within each category according to annual cost, which means they take both the interest rate and any fees into account. I&rsquo;ve assumed that you&rsquo;re remortgaging with a property costing &pound;250,000 (the mortgage amounts vary for the different examples).</p>
                              <p>I&rsquo;ve also included one example in each loan to value level of the cheapest deal according to interest rate alone.</p>
                              <p><strong>SAVVY TIP</strong>: As a general rule, the smaller your mortgage, the more of an effect any arrangement fees have on the overall cost of the mortgage. The length of time of the deal also has an influence. If there&rsquo;s a big arrangement fee spread over a five year fixed rate term, it&rsquo;s obviously cheaper than if it&rsquo;s only spread over a two year fixed rate term.</p>
                              <h3>Up to 75% loan to value (&pound;180,000 mortgage on a &pound;250,000 property)</h3>
                              <p><strong>The AA</strong></p>
                              <p>The AA has a two-year fixed rate mortgage that charges 2.09% interest until 31<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;December 2020. There are no product fees and there&rsquo;s no valuation fee. However, you have to pay your legal fees. You get a cashback of &pound;750. Find out more on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theaa.com/mortgages">mortgages section</a>&nbsp;of The AA&rsquo;s website.</p>
                              <p><strong>Annual cost</strong>: Based on a &pound;180,000 repayment mortgage over 25 years, you&rsquo;d pay &pound;8,875 a year over the two-year term. This takes the cashback into account. Your monthly mortgage payments would be &pound;771.</p>
                              <p><strong>Penalties</strong>: There&rsquo;s an early repayment fee of 3%, reducing to 2%, until 21.12.20 and an exit fee of &pound;195.</p>
                              <p><strong>Overpayments allowed</strong>: You can overpay by up to 10% of the balance you owe each year.</p>
                              <p><strong>Standard Variable Rate</strong>: After the deal runs out, if you can&rsquo;t get another deal you&rsquo;ll have to pay the standard variable rate (SVR) which is 4.74%.</p>
                              <p><strong>SAVVY TIP</strong>: Because this isn&rsquo;t the lowest interest rate of the best buy mortgages, if you have a bigger mortgage, it may not be the cheapest.</p>
